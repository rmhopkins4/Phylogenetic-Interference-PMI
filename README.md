# Phylogenetic-Interference-PMI
Based on Gerhard JÃ¤ger's 2013 paper called "Phylogenetic Inference from Word Lists Using Weighted Alignment with Empirically Determined Weights"

The purpose of this project is to develop a way to use wordlists from languages to determine their relatedness.
Having run this project, a PMI matrix, along with an open gap and extend gap penalty, has been defined. 
With this matrix, a distance measure coined "Distance Based On Evidence of Relatedness using Pointiwse Mutual Information (dERC/PMI) is developed.
